<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Genetics</strong> <strong>Study Notes 1</strong></p>
<p><br>Basic Terminology: Gene: A segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein, influencing <span style="color: #ba372a;">particular</span> traits. Allele:</p>
<p>Different versions of a gene. For example, alleles for eye color may result in blue, green, or brown eyes. Genotype: The genetic makeup of an individual, consisting of the alleles inherited from both parents.</p>
<p>Phenotype: The physical expression or characteristics resulting from the genotype, influenced by both genes and the environment.</p>
<p>Homozygous: Having two identical alleles for a particular gene (e.g., AA or aa). Heterozygous: Having two different alleles for a gene (e.g., Aa). 2.</p>
<p>Mendelian Genetics: Law of Segregation: Each parent carries two alleles for each gene, but only one allele is passed to offspring. This ensures that offspring inherit one df. helloallele from each parent. Law of Independent</p>
<p>&nbsp;Assortment: Genes for different traits are inherited independently of each other.</p>
