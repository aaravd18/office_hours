Microeconomics Lecture Notes - Supply & Demand

Demand = how much of a product people are willing to buy at different prices
    Law of Demand: As price increases, quantity demanded decreases; as price decreases, quantity demanded increases (inverse relationship)
    Ceteris paribus - "all else equal" (assumes no other factors change)
    Demand curve: slopes downward
    Factors that shift demand (different from moving along the curve):
        - Income changes
        - Tastes/preferences
        - Price of related goods (substitutes/complements)
        - Expectations of future prices
        - Number of consumers in the market

Supply = how much producers are willing to sell at different prices
    Law of Supply: As price increases, quantity supplied increases; as price decreases, quantity supplied decreases (direct relationship)
    Supply curve: slopes upward
    Shifts in supply (again, different from moving along curve):
        - Input prices (labor, raw materials, etc.)
        - Technological advancements
        - Expectations of future prices
        - Number of producers in the market
        - Government policies (taxes, subsidies, etc.)

Equilibrium: where supply equals demand (Price* and Quantity*)
    No shortages or surpluses here
    Changes in demand or supply shift the equilibrium (e.g., if demand increases, Price* and Quantity* increase)
    Surplus: excess supply (Quantity supplied > Quantity demanded)
    Shortage: excess demand (Quantity demanded > Quantity supplied)

Elasticity (how sensitive quantity is to price change)
    Price elasticity of demand (PED) = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price
        - If PED > 1, demand is elastic (responsive to price)
        - If PED < 1, demand is inelastic (not responsive)
    Determinants of elasticity:
        - Availability of substitutes (more substitutes = more elastic)
        - Necessity vs luxury
        - Time horizon (longer time = more elastic)

Consumer surplus = difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay (area above price and below demand curve)
Producer surplus = difference between what producers are paid and their costs (area below price and above supply curve)

Random notes:
    Professor said equilibrium can shift in the short run, but markets tend to correct themselves over time (long run)
    Example: when gas prices spike, people drive less (elastic demand in short term), but over time might buy fuel-efficient cars, making demand more inelastic in the long run?
    Mentioned something about price ceilings and price floorsâ€”government intervention? Should read more about that.
