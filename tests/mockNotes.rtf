Biology: Genetics

1. Introduction to Genetics

    Definition: The study of heredity and variation of organisms.
    Founder: Gregor Mendel, known as the "Father of Genetics."
    Key Concepts:
        Genes: Units of heredity; segments of DNA that code for proteins.
        Alleles: Different versions of a gene (e.g., dominant and recessive).

2. DNA Structure

    DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): Molecule that carries genetic information.
    Structure: Double helix, composed of nucleotides.
        Nucleotide Components: Sugar (deoxyribose), phosphate group, nitrogenous base.
        Bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G).
        Base Pairing Rules: A pairs with T, C pairs with G.

3. Mendelian Genetics

    Mendel's Laws:
        Law of Segregation: Each parent contributes one allele for a trait, which segregate during gamete formation.
        Law of Independent Assortment: Alleles for different traits are distributed to sex cells (& offspring) independently of one another.
    Punnett Squares: Tool to predict the probability of offspring traits.
        Genotype: Genetic makeup (e.g., BB, Bb, bb).
        Phenotype: Physical expression of traits (e.g., brown eyes).
        Homozygous: Two identical alleles (e.g., BB or bb).
        Heterozygous: Two different alleles (e.g., Bb).

4. Patterns of Inheritance

    Dominant vs. Recessive Traits:
        Dominant Allele: Expressed if present (e.g., B).
        Recessive Allele: Expressed only if two copies are present (e.g., b).
    Co-dominance: Both alleles are fully expressed (e.g., blood type AB).
    Incomplete Dominance: Blending of traits (e.g., red flower + white flower = pink flower).
    Sex-linked Traits: Traits associated with genes located on sex chromosomes (e.g., hemophilia, color blindness).

5. DNA Replication & Protein Synthesis

    DNA Replication: Process by which DNA makes a copy of itself.
        Occurs in the nucleus during the S-phase of the cell cycle.
        Enzymes Involved: Helicase (unzips DNA), DNA polymerase (adds nucleotides).
    Protein Synthesis:
        Transcription: DNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus.
        Translation: mRNA is translated into amino acids at the ribosome to form proteins.
        Central Dogma: DNA → RNA → Protein.

6. Genetic Mutations

    Definition: Changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA.
    Types of Mutations:
        Point Mutation: Change in a single nucleotide (e.g., substitution).
        Frameshift Mutation: Insertion or deletion of a nucleotide, altering the reading frame.
        Chromosomal Mutations: Changes affecting large segments of chromosomes (e.g., duplication, deletion, inversion).
    Causes: Errors during DNA replication, environmental factors (e.g., radiation).

7. Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering

    Genetic Engineering: Manipulation of an organism's DNA.
        Examples: Gene therapy, GMO crops, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.
    Cloning: Producing identical copies of DNA or entire organisms.
        Example: Dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned from an adult somatic cell.
    DNA Fingerprinting: Technique used for identification based on unique DNA sequences.

8. Human Genetics

    Karyotype: Visual representation of chromosomes in a cell; used to detect chromosomal abnormalities.
    Pedigree Charts: Diagrams used to track inheritance patterns across generations.
    Genetic Disorders:
        Autosomal Disorders: Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia.
        Sex-linked Disorders: Hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

9. Key Terms to Remember

    Haploid (n): One set of chromosomes (e.g., gametes).
    Diploid (2n): Two sets of chromosomes (e.g., somatic cells).
    Genome: The complete set of genes or genetic material in an organism.
    Genetic Variation: Differences in DNA sequences among individuals; important for evolution.
